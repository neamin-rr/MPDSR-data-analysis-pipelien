# MPDSR Data Analysis Pipeline

This pipeline analyzes data from the Maternal and Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) system, which is part of Ethiopia's integrated Public Health Emergency Management (PHEM) framework. The pipeline processes two complementary data streams:

Weekly Surveillance Notifications: Aggregate data collected through routine reporting channels

Case-Based Review Data: Detailed investigations of individual maternal and perinatal deaths

The pipeline integrates these two data sources to provide comprehensive analysis of maternal and perinatal mortality patterns across Ethiopia.
