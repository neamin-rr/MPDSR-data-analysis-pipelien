# MPDSR-data-analysis-pipelien
MPDSR is part of the integrated IDSR, which corresponds to PHEM in the Ethiopian context. The system has two channels of data sources: one is weekly notifications, followed by detailed case-based reviews of deaths. The pipeline is designed to analyze both weekly notifications and case-based data coming from across Ethiopia.
